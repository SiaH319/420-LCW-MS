[Total number of board positions checked]
1. Hamming distance:
    puzzle4x4-01.txt -> 2
    puzzle4x4-10.txt -> 39
    puzzle4x4-16.txt -> 154
    puzzle4x4-20.txt -> 2076
    puzzle4x4-25.txt -> 59564
2. Manhattan distance: 
    puzzle4x4-01.txt -> 2
    puzzle4x4-10.txt -> 17
    puzzle4x4-16.txt -> 33
    puzzle4x4-20.txt -> 33
    puzzle4x4-25.txt -> 553


observations:

The total number of board positions checked when computing a solution 
by Manhattan distance is smaller than the one by using Hamming distance 
as the number of times the main loop executed was smaller. 
Still, in both cases, the number of moves required increases 
as the maximum number of items on the priority queue increases.
